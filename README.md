# Spring Boot Demo Web-shop     
### Welcome visitor and thank you for paying attention to my work.     

# Global introduction
The entire project was built from scratch by my own hands and is continuously under development.    
This is only a BackEnd oriented project without any kind of UI included.   
The project is not installed on any network!           
You can freely download the repository and try it out on a local machine.    

### You will need a basic Development Environment:
- **IDE** (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.) for manage or editing the code if you need
- **API Development Tool** (ex: Postman) for testing the API since there is no frontend
- **Java 17**
- **Maven**
- **Optional: MY-SQL or any DB connection tool**   
(We basically use a built-in H2 in-memory database, so you don't need to care about it)      


**Please notice that this is a hobby project that does not represent any kind of real business value.     
Sometimes it does not follow the general user requirements    
and in some places, it may contain seemingly unnecessary, or less relevant features.**

**The main goal was to practice the Spring Boot environment and the tools it provides.    
I just wanted to make a simple and well-functioning system at the basic level.    
I am building the project for practice and self-development,       
in the future I would like to try and implement other technologies and additional functions.**
